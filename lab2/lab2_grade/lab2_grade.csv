(qualitative), Does a response to one question help predict the other? (quantitative)",2,"I don't think Figure 1 is particularly informative. You can just tell the reader how much is missing. Figure 2 is also not particularly helpful; I'd rather you just say ""there were lat/lon outside of continental US which were removed"". The plot text is quite small and hard to read, particularly in Figure 4. ",Transformed categorical data to binary encoding correctly AND discussed why binary encoding is necessary,1,3,1,2,"+1 for using more than one dim reduction method. In Figure 6, I think a non-default color scheme may have been better. Would also like to see scree plots and/or plots of the components on a map.",3,2,2,"Tried at least two different clustering methods, Found groups/clusters of people, which are related to location, Which questions produce this continuum or separate the clusters? (i.e., perform some type of investigation into the feature patterns), How did you choose the number of clusters?",4,"In Figure 8, weird spacing makes it seem like the corresponding question is actually the one below the map. I'd like to see a more quantitative evidence for choice of K, e.g. using silhouette for k-means.",2,"What happens when you perturb the data set?, What happens when you use different starting points in the algorithm?",2,"Commented on the usefulness of data / clusters for future decision-making AND explained reasoning, Gave an example reality check",2,3,4,"You were ambitious in taking on t-SNE and autoencoders. This made for an interesting and unique report, but lacking many details and the visualizations need work. My guess is you lost a lot of time trying to fancier methods.",48,7,,2,1,58
