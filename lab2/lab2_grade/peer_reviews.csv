133561,Yes.,Could be better commented to make it easier to read.,"Report is a bit unclear at points with some grammatical errors/typos. For eg., it is unclear what ""the most frequent answer"" means in Fig 4.","The author considered Q109 and Q120 for analysis. The log odds idea is interesting. I wonder whether the geographical variation in answer ""sack"" for Q109 is due to its lower frequency (8%) and hence, potentially higher variance across states, or is it purely an indicator of geographical variation. ",The trends seem clear.,I would improve the alignment of the figures and associated questions.,"The author used PCA, t-SNE and Autoencoder for dimensionality reduction. ",I liked the use of density plots for visualization of dimension reduced data.,Would've been nice to see heatmaps of the principal components to get a sense of how different the outputs of these methods are.,The author used k-means on the dimension reduced data. The clusters seem to have a geographical meaning.,I liked the side-by-side comparison plots for different k and dimensionality reduction techniques.,Alignment of log odds plots.,Stability analysis makes sense. I would've started off with k=3 as the original hypothesis as that seems to be the most stable hypothesis across all dimensionality reduction techniques.
133561,I cannot load loadData() functions locally...,It would be better if you could remove unnecessary empty newlines.,It would be better to add an empty newline between two paragraphs in R Markdown.,It would be better to make two contingency tables separately rather than in one table.,The comparison of log odds ratio is clear.,The title is too far away above the plot.,The author tried 3 ways of dimensionality reduction and made clear comparisons. But centering/scaling is not mentioned.,The density plot is cool.,You may try other pairs of PCs.,"The author uses PCA, t-SNE and Auto Encoder to cluster the data with (k = 3,4,5). The analysis is complete and convincing. The plots of log odds ratio help validate the conclusions.",The clustering figures clearly shows the difference between multuple clustering methods and tuning parameters.,The title is too far away above the plot.,The author run t-SNE two more times after bootstrapping the dataset. I think that makes sense.
