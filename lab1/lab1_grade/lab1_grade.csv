133561,2,"Please include the R code to run the cleaning steps and generate your plots in the Rmd file rather than run everything and save the plots separately. Your Rmd doesn't actually run any code, so as is the report is not actually reproducible but just a static document. When I compile it it should rerun all steps of your analysis.",4,Try to use <- for assignment and = only for function arguments. There are a few places where the line lengths go above 80 characters.,4,3,2,2,"Found that there were two trees, Noticed that the reported dates were weird in one way or another, Noticed other inconsistencies in the data",3,3,More details of cleaning steps needed and a more careful analysis of outliers.,3,4,Nice! I love Figure 4. Use of color is effective.,2,2,2,"Interesting, but I find this plot hard to interpret. Why so much white space on the right? Also, it's not immediately clear what the yellow points are, so you should say so in the legend or in the caption. I also think this is more of a data cleaning consideration than a finding.",2,4,"Again, I think this belongs in data cleaning.",2,2,"Figure 1 already seems to tell us this relationship should exist between dew point and humidity. What do the colors here represent? Calculating dew point is a cool way to combine temperature and humidity, so perhaps it would be interesting to bring in a third variable that doesn't involve the temp or humidity, such as node direction or height. ",2,,"Excellent work on the EDA section. I think you were very ambitious and ran out of time, so in the future labs I suggest you try to make things more focused and spend more time on the text to explain your nice plots. Definitely a challenge, but you have a good start on the visualization side of things.",2,2,52
