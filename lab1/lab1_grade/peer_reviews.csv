Though, it wasn't obvious to me that there was an overall narrative and domain question, it was quite clear what the author was trying to do in each part. I would have liked a more detailed explanation of dew point, as it is not really mentioned in the paper.","I think the cleaning process was not detailed enough. The author decided to remove all nodes with `result_time = '2004-11-10 14:25:00'`. I think this was a mistake: the corresponding readings (ie, those from the data logger) were not necessarily faulty, and their actual date could have been recovered using the dates data.",I think Figure 4 contained a bit too much information for a explanatory plot.,"Visually, I think the figures would have benefited from a customised ggplot theme, and a better color scale, such as viridis.","The reality check was relevant to the problem, in that it verified that the result checked out with prior knowledge (more sunlight during the day) and expert knowledge (correlation between dew point and temperature, for different humidity levels).",4,"The red really makes node 109 stand out, which is good. However, I'm not sure height was relevant for this figure. Also, there are so many points for each node that the information we get is mostly the range of temperature/RH for each node - but we could also be interested in the quantiles or means.",2,"I don't think including the id of each node on the figure added a lot of information. Also, height was used both for colour and the y-axis.",3,"Time was used both for the x-axis and for colour. Unlike the author, I don't think the plot suggests much of a trend.","I think the check was relevant, but it's only one perturbation. More perturbations would probably have been helpful to establish the phenomenon.",

The images were inserted.",No code.,"The report is readable. However, there are one or two small typos.","The cleaning was well described and (I guess, since I do not have the code) applied as said.",Yes. All figures have a purpose that is discussed in the report.,The figures are complete and beautifully done.,"Yes. The reality check helps figuring the relevance of the data, and it confirms its validity.",5,"A missing item in the legend. Otherwise, it is complete.",3,Pretty figure.,4,"The title, the legend and the text do not say the same thing about what is plotted. I guess it is Humidity and Temperature instead of Dew Points and Humidity.",The check is indeed relevant to the finding. And it strenghten the idea that the finding is a real phenomenon,
