133561,"Ronen, Omer",4,,4,"The PCA is interesting. One thing I'm not sure about is including X & Y. The pixel position is just a fixed set of coordinates that aren't particularly meaningful. If it was lat/lon instead, it might be more meaningful. I'd also suggest using only the training data since we're kind of ",4,Great!,1,3,3,3,,3,2,Love the radar plot! Good work looking at a variety of metrics rather than just accuracy.,4,In Figure 9 I think the colors for the continuous scale (Cloud Prob) should be more distinct from those for the labels.,3,,5,5,4,4,,4,,Great work!,5,,56,61
